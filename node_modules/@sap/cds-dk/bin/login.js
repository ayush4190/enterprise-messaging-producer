# SYNOPSIS

    *cds login* [ <app-url> ]

    Simplifies usage of ${cdsExtendAndCdsActivate} commands related to multitenant
    SaaS applications by providing them with automatic authentication: fetches and
    saves authentication tokens and provides relevant tokens to those commands.

    Saves further settings for the current project (<app-url>, <tenant-subdomain>, and
    URLs for passcodes and tokens).

    *Multiple targets*

    When re-running this command with different app URLs and subdomains, previous
    logins are not affected, allowing simultaneous logins to different API endpoints
    on SAP Business Technology Platform, Cloud Foundry environment.
    ${cdsExtendAndCdsActivate} will be authenticated according to the given target.

    If the Cloud-Foundry command-line client is installed, the SaaS-app URL <app-url>
    may be omitted. In that case, suitable apps from the org and space you're currently
    logged in to will be presented to determine <app-url>.

    In case <app-url> does not start with a schema, 'https://' is assumed.

    *Token Expiration*

    If a refresh token has been provided with the original token and the original
    token has expired, it will be automatically renewed.

    *Storing Authentication Data*

    Authentication data for all logins is saved by <app-url> and <tenant-subdomain> in the
    desktop keyring (${keyring} on your platform) or, if requested, in config
    file ${config.paths.auth}.

    To make use of keyring storage, the 'keytar' Node.js module must be installed.
    A corresponding hint will be given in case the module is not found.

    Project settings are saved by project directory in config file
    ${config.paths.settings}.

    Note that local storage of authentication data incurs a certain security risk:
    a malicious locally-running application might be able to perform any action with
    the SaaS app that you are authorized for with respect to your tenant.

# OPTIONS

    *-s* | *--subdomain* <tenant-subdomain>

        The subdomain to log in to. By default, it's determined from project settings.
        If no such setting is saved, the CF client is invoked to determine the respective subdomain.

    *-d* | *--directory* <extension-project-directory>

        The extension-project folder (relevant for loading and saving settings).
        If omitted, either an existing subdirectory named as the subdomain or the current
        working directory will be used.

    *-p* | *--passcode* <passcode>

        Tenant-specific passcode for authentication.

    *-c* | *--clientid* <clientid>

        Client ID for authentication. This will override the default Client ID from environment.

    *--plain*

        Instead of saving authentication data for this login to the desktop keyring,
        use plain-text storage, e.g. if you have not installed the 'keytar' module.
        Note that this is not recommended as it decreases the level of security: at
        least applications running as the current user can read the plain-text file,
        whereas the keyring (depending on the platform) can be locked and unlocked on owner
        request and may hide data saved by this command from other applications you run.

        Be aware that on SAP Business Application Studio, --plain is enforced since keyring
        functionality is not supported. However, the underlying storage is encrypted.

        During any login, potential pre-existing authentication data for the same
        target is deleted from the other, non-selected storage. This allows
        migrating authentication data from one storage to the other by running
        the present command without a passcode.
