# SYNOPSIS

    and subdomain, optionally including relevant project settings.
    
    <app-url> and <tenant-subdomain> will be determined from project settings unless given
    by options.
    
    Project settings will be loaded by reference to the given folder.
    If omitted, the project setting are loaded from a subdirectory named as the subdomain
    or the current working directory.
    
    To access keyring storage, the 'keytar' Node.js module must be installed.
    If this is not the case, existing keyring entries will not be detected and
    cannot be removed by this command.
